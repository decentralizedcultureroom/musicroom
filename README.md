# MUSIC ROOM - CONCEPT

Imagine a computer game without music. A movie without sound. Inspiring creativity through music can be pivotal when brainstorming for your hackathon project. __Exposing the hackers to the emotions and vibrations that music can bring, consequently can become a method to push novel ideas into action.__

`Pierre Burel` will introduce you to the world of building instruments with unconventional materials. `Simon Schmidt` will show you how to “hack” and create your own loop station through code and controllers. `Nicholas Bamberger` will amuse you with his seductive piano improvisation. `Limboski` will open your heart with sarcastic love songs. `Stephen Paul Taylor` is there to make sure that in every situation there’s a place for an underground party.
